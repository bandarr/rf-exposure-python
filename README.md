# rf-exposure-python
Python for rf-eposure

This program calculates RF exposure limits for amateur radio transimissions, based on https://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/RFsafetyCommittee/RF+Exposure+and+You.pdf

I wrote this program in order to have something interesting to write while learning a new programming language.  
This software has been written for my personal use and I make no guarantees about its accuracy.  I am not an electrical engineer, and I don't completely understand the document from which my calculations were derived.
